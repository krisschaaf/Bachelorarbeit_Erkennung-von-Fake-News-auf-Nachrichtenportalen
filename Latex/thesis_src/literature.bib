	abstract = {Indiscriminate elimination of harmful fake news risks destroying satirical news, which can be benign or even beneficial, because both types of news share highly similar textual cues. In this work we applied a recent development in neural network architecture, transformers, to the task of separating satirical news from fake news. Transformers have hitherto not been applied to this specific problem. Our evaluation results on a publicly available and carefully curated dataset show that the performance from a classifier framework built around a DistilBERT architecture performed better than existing machine-learning approaches. Additional improvement over baseline DistilBERT was achieved through the use of non-standard tokenization schemes as well as varying the pre-training and text pre-processing strategies. The improvement over existing approaches stands at 0.0429 (5.2%) in F1 and 0.0522 (6.4%) in accuracy. Further evaluation on two additional datasets shows our framework's ability to generalize across datasets without diminished performance.},

Fake news is not a recent concept, but it is a commonly occurring phenomenon in current times. The consequence of fake news can range from being merely annoying to influencing and misleading societies or even nations. A variety of approaches exist to identify fake news.

Some approaches are illustrated with a relevant example as well as the challenges and the appropriate context in which the specific approach can be used.},

To combat this infodemic, there is an urgent need for benchmark datasets that can help researchers develop and evaluate models geared towards automatic detection of disinformation. While there are increasing efforts to create adequate, open-source benchmark datasets for English, comparable resources are virtually unavailable for German, leaving research for the German language lagging significantly behind. In this paper, we introduce the new benchmark dataset FANG-COVID consisting of 28,056 real and 13,186 fake German news articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as data on their propagation on Twitter. Furthermore, we propose an explainable textual- and social context-based model for fake news detection, compare its performance to {\textquotedblleft}black-box{\textquotedblright} models and perform feature ablation to assess the relative importance of human-interpretable features in distinguishing fake news from authentic news.},

	abstract = {In today's post-truth world, the proliferation of propaganda and falsified news poses a deadly risk of misinforming the public on a variety of issues, either through traditional media or on social media. Information people acquire through these articles and posts tends to shape their world view and provides reasoning for choices they take in their day to day lives. Thus, fake news can definitely be a malicious force, having massive real-world consequences. In this paper, we focus on classifying fake news using models based on a natural language processing framework, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, also known as BERT. We fine-tune BERT for specific domain datasets and also make use of human justification and metadata for added performance in our models. We determine that the deep-contextualizing nature of BERT is effective for this task and obtain significant improvement over binary classification, and minimal yet important improvement in six-label classification in comparison with previously explored models.},

@article{SHEIKHI2021107559,
	abstract = {In recent years, with the fast development of the internet and online platforms such as social media feeds, news blogs, and online newspapers, deceptive reports have been universally spread online. This manipulated news is a matter of concern due to its potential role in shaping public opinion. Therefore, the fast spread of fake news creates an urgent need for automatic systems to detect deceitful articles. This motivates many researchers to introduce solutions for the automatic classification of news items. This paper proposed a novel system to detect fake news articles based on content-based features and the WOA-Xgbtree algorithm. The proposed system can be applied in different scenarios to classify news articles. The proposed approach consists of two main stages: first, the useful features are extracted and analyzed, and then an Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree (xgbTree) algorithm optimized by the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to classify news articles using extracted features. In our experiments, we considered the bases of the investigation on classification accuracy and the F1-measure. Then, we compared the optimized model with several benchmark classification algorithms based on a dataset that compiled over 40,000 various news articles recently. The results indicate that the proposed approach achieved good classification accuracy and F1 measure rate and successfully classified over 91 percent of articles.},

@article{Sharma:2024,
	abstract = {As social media and web-based forums have grown in popularity, the fast-spreading trend of fake news has become a major threat to the government and other agencies. With the rise of social media and internet platforms, misinformation may quickly spread over borders and language boundaries. Detecting and neutralizing fake news in several languages can help to protect the integrity of global elections, political discourse, and public opinion. The lack of a robust multilingual database for training the classification models makes detecting fake news a difficult task. This paper looks at it by describing several forms of fake news (like serious fabrications, large-scale hoaxes, stance news, deceptive news, satire news, clickbait, misinformation, rumour). This review paper includes different steps, features, tools for mitigating the scourge of information pollution, and different available datasets. This study presented a taxonomy for detecting fake news, which gives a comprehensive overview and analysis of existing DL-based algorithms focusing on diverse techniques. This paper also includes the monolingual and multilingual fake news detection models. Finally, this paper ends with the technical challenges.},

@article{socsci9100185,
	abstract = {Combating the spread of fake news remains a difficult problem. For this reason, it is increasingly urgent to understand the phenomenon of fake news. This review aims to see why fake news is widely shared on social media and why some people believe it. The presentation of its structure (from the images chosen, the format of the titles and the language used in the text) can explain the reasons for going viral and what factors are associated with the belief in fake news. We show that fake news explores all possible aspects to attract the reader's attention, from the formation of the title to the language used throughout the body of the text. The proliferation and success of fake news are associated with its characteristics (more surreal, exaggerated, impressive, emotional, persuasive, clickbait, shocking images), which seem to be strategically thought out and exploited by the creators of fake news. This review shows that fake news continues to be widely shared and consumed because that is the main objective of its creators. Although some studies do not support these correlations, it appears that conservatives, right-wing people, the elderly and less educated people are more likely to believe and spread fake news.},
