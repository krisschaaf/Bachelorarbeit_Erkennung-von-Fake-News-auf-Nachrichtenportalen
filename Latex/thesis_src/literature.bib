@article{Wang:2020aa,
	abstract = {The representational basis for downstream natural language processing tasks is word embeddings, which capture lexical semantics in numerical form to handle the abstract semantic concept of words. Recently, the word embeddings approaches, represented by deep learning, has attracted extensive attention and widely used in many tasks, such as text classification, knowledge mining, question-answering, smart Internet of Things systems and so on. These neural networks-based models are based on the distributed hypothesis while the semantic association between words can be efficiently calculated in low-dimensional space. However, the expressed semantics of most models are constrained by the context distribution of each word in the corpus while the logic and common knowledge are not better utilized. Therefore, how to use the massive multi-source data to better represent natural language and world knowledge still need to be explored. In this paper, we introduce the recent advances of neural networks-based word embeddings with their technical features, summarizing the key challenges and existing solutions, and further give a future outlook on the research and application.},

	abstract = {Research on different machine learning (ML) has become incredibly popular during the past few decades. However, for some researchers not familiar with statistics, it might be difficult to understand how to evaluate the performance of ML models and compare them with each other. Here, we introduce the most common evaluation metrics used for the typical supervised ML tasks including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, regression, image segmentation, object detection, and information retrieval. We explain how to choose a suitable statistical test for comparing models, how to obtain enough values of the metric for testing, and how to perform the test and interpret its results. We also present a few practical examples about comparing convolutional neural networks used to classify X-rays with different lung infections and detect cancer tumors in positron emission tomography images.},

	abstract = {The growing complexity, diversity, and importance of software pose a significant threat to computer system security due to exploitable software vulnerabilities. Important infrastructure systems, including banking, electricity, healthcare, and the military, are at risk of loss due to these vulnerabilities that permit unwanted access. This study investigates statistical features that contribute to improved outcomes, even though existing approaches primarily utilize natural language processing for vulnerability descriptions. We present an innovative scoring method that incorporates six well-known machine learning techniques: Linear Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, K Nearest Neighbors Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor into its framework. An assessment is conducted on 159,979 vulnerabilities obtained from the National Vulnerability Database using six metrics: explained variance, mean absolute error, mean squared log error, R-squared, root mean squared error, and mean squared error. GridSearchCV and tenfold cross-validation have validated the Random Forest Regressor as superior, yielding an accuracy of 0.9486. This approach demonstrates promise in proactive risk management across multiple sectors, including healthcare, energy, defense, and finance, by integrating machine learning techniques and statistical features.},

Das {\"o}ffentlich-rechtliche Fernsehen genie{\ss}t unter den Medien zwar nach wie vor das gr{\"o}{\ss}te Vertrauen und die h{\"o}chste Glaubw{\"u}rdigkeit, es muss jedoch geradezu einen ‚ÄûGenerationsabriss`` bei der Nutzung hinnehmen. Das Internet hat das Fernsehen auch beim Meinungsbildungsgewicht - vor allem bei der j{\"u}ngeren Generation - {\"u}berholt.Von der Utopie, dass {\"u}ber das ‚ÄûWorld Wide Web`` jeder und jede unzensiert das Grundrecht auf Pressefreiheit wahrnehmen k{\"o}nnte und dass so eine basisdemokratische, herrschaftsfreie Kommunikation m{\"o}glich w{\"u}rde, sind wir weit entfernt. Der professionelle Journalismus hat seine Torw{\"a}chter-Funktion gegen{\"u}ber den ‚Äûsozialen Medien`` verloren. Die angeblich ‚Äûkostenfreien`` Internet-Oligopole von Facebook und Co. sind vor allem ‚ÄûDatenkraken``, Werbenetzwerke und ein Einfallstor f{\"u}r Manipulatoren. Trotz aller Regulierungsversuche erleben wir einen ‚Äû{\"U}berwachungskapitalismus``, private Zensur, eine Verrohung der Sprache, Hass und Falschmeldungen, verunsichernde Desinformationen, eine (populistische) Radikalisierung von Meinungen und eine Spaltung der {\"O}ffentlichkeit.Der autorit{\"a}re Charakter der digitalen Revolution und die ‚Äûkalifornische Ideologie``, wonach die Technik alle Probleme besser l{\"o}st als die Politik, machen eine ‚ÄûDemokratisierung des Digitalen`` zu einer dr{\"a}ngenden Zukunftsaufgabe. Was spricht gegen ein {\"o}ffentliches, beitragsfinanziertes Internetangebot?},

	abstract = {Landslide Susceptibility Map (LSM) is one of the essential tools for town planner's/ government institutions to make the decision about land use planning. Utilisation of LSM map, will prevent the anthropogenic activities to be executed at essential level at high or very high landslide susceptible locations and thus mitigate the risk due to such natural hazards. The present study integrates the two strategies for LSM modelling in which the first one is to evaluate the effect of various feature engineering techniques applied on causative factors measured at ratio scale while the another one is hyper-parameters tuning of implemented Machine Learning (ML) algorithm i.e. decision tree. All the models were created using statistical/ML techniques based on fourteen pre-processed causative factors which are acquired or derived primarily using remote sensing. These factors includes topographic, anthropogenic, and environmental features while geological factor is acquired from the open domain. The Area under Receiver Operating Characteristics and overall accuracy measures were used for assessing the performance of various implemented approaches for LSM. The study area considered for the present study is Rishikesh to Gangotri axis situated in the Uttarakhand province of India. Comparative study of such statistical and ML models using different types of feature engineering techniques as well as hyper-parameters tuning is the first time attempted and can be used in futuristic analysis of LSM generation for other geographic areas too.},

Everyone is using the Internet, creating and sharing content on social media, but not all the information is valid, and no one is verifying the originality of the content. Identifying the content's essence is sometimes complicated for researchers and intelligent researchers. For example, during Covid-19, misinformation spread worldwide about the outbreak, and much false information spread faster than the virus. This misinformation will create a problem for the public and mislead people into taking the proper medicine. This work will help us to improve the prediction rate. Here we investigate the ability of machine learning classifiers and deep learning models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor. Deep learning models include Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The various types of machine learning and deep learning models will be trained and tested using the Covid-19 dataset (1,375,592 tweets).},

@article{ZHANG2008879,
	abstract = {One of the main themes which support text mining is text representation; that is, its task is to look for appropriate terms to transfer documents into numerical vectors. Recently, many efforts have been invested on this topic to enrich text representation using vector space model (VSM) to improve the performances of text mining techniques such as text classification and text clustering. The main concern in this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of using multi-words for text representation on the performances of text classification. Firstly, a practical method is proposed to implement the multi-word extraction from documents based on the syntactical structure. Secondly, two strategies as general concept representation and subtopic representation are presented to represent the documents using the extracted multi-words. In particular, the dynamic k-mismatch is proposed to determine the presence of a long multi-word which is a subtopic of the content of a document. Finally, we carried out a series of experiments on classifying the Reuters-21578 documents using the representations with multi-words. We used the performance of representation in individual words as the baseline, which has the largest dimension of feature set for representation without linguistic preprocessing. Moreover, linear kernel and non-linear polynomial kernel in support vector machines (SVM) are examined comparatively for classification to investigate the effect of kernel type on their performances. Index terms with low information gain (IG) are removed from the feature set at different percentages to observe the robustness of each classification method. Our experiments demonstrate that in multi-word representation, subtopic representation outperforms the general concept representation and the linear kernel outperforms the non-linear kernel of SVM in classifying the Reuters data. The effect of applying different representation strategies is greater than the effect of applying the different SVM kernels on classification performance. Furthermore, the representation using individual words outperforms any representation using multi-words. This is consistent with the major opinions concerning the role of linguistic preprocessing on documents' features when using SVM for text classification.},

@article{LOW2022115824,
	abstract = {Indiscriminate elimination of harmful fake news risks destroying satirical news, which can be benign or even beneficial, because both types of news share highly similar textual cues. In this work we applied a recent development in neural network architecture, transformers, to the task of separating satirical news from fake news. Transformers have hitherto not been applied to this specific problem. Our evaluation results on a publicly available and carefully curated dataset show that the performance from a classifier framework built around a DistilBERT architecture performed better than existing machine-learning approaches. Additional improvement over baseline DistilBERT was achieved through the use of non-standard tokenization schemes as well as varying the pre-training and text pre-processing strategies. The improvement over existing approaches stands at 0.0429 (5.2%) in F1 and 0.0522 (6.4%) in accuracy. Further evaluation on two additional datasets shows our framework's ability to generalize across datasets without diminished performance.},

Fake news is not a recent concept, but it is a commonly occurring phenomenon in current times. The consequence of fake news can range from being merely annoying to influencing and misleading societies or even nations. A variety of approaches exist to identify fake news. By conducting a systematic literature review, we identify the main approaches currently available to identify fake news and how these approaches can be applied in different situations. Some approaches are illustrated with a relevant example as well as the challenges and the appropriate context in which the specific approach can be used.},

To combat this infodemic, there is an urgent need for benchmark datasets that can help researchers develop and evaluate models geared towards automatic detection of disinformation. While there are increasing efforts to create adequate, open-source benchmark datasets for English, comparable resources are virtually unavailable for German, leaving research for the German language lagging significantly behind. In this paper, we introduce the new benchmark dataset FANG-COVID consisting of 28,056 real and 13,186 fake German news articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as data on their propagation on Twitter. Furthermore, we propose an explainable textual- and social context-based model for fake news detection, compare its performance to {\textquotedblleft}black-box{\textquotedblright} models and perform feature ablation to assess the relative importance of human-interpretable features in distinguishing fake news from authentic news.},

	abstract = {In today's post-truth world, the proliferation of propaganda and falsified news poses a deadly risk of misinforming the public on a variety of issues, either through traditional media or on social media. Information people acquire through these articles and posts tends to shape their world view and provides reasoning for choices they take in their day to day lives. Thus, fake news can definitely be a malicious force, having massive real-world consequences. In this paper, we focus on classifying fake news using models based on a natural language processing framework, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, also known as BERT. We fine-tune BERT for specific domain datasets and also make use of human justification and metadata for added performance in our models. We determine that the deep-contextualizing nature of BERT is effective for this task and obtain significant improvement over binary classification, and minimal yet important improvement in six-label classification in comparison with previously explored models.},

@article{SHEIKHI2021107559,
	abstract = {In recent years, with the fast development of the internet and online platforms such as social media feeds, news blogs, and online newspapers, deceptive reports have been universally spread online. This manipulated news is a matter of concern due to its potential role in shaping public opinion. Therefore, the fast spread of fake news creates an urgent need for automatic systems to detect deceitful articles. This motivates many researchers to introduce solutions for the automatic classification of news items. This paper proposed a novel system to detect fake news articles based on content-based features and the WOA-Xgbtree algorithm. The proposed system can be applied in different scenarios to classify news articles. The proposed approach consists of two main stages: first, the useful features are extracted and analyzed, and then an Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree (xgbTree) algorithm optimized by the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to classify news articles using extracted features. In our experiments, we considered the bases of the investigation on classification accuracy and the F1-measure. Then, we compared the optimized model with several benchmark classification algorithms based on a dataset that compiled over 40,000 various news articles recently. The results indicate that the proposed approach achieved good classification accuracy and F1 measure rate and successfully classified over 91 percent of articles.},

@article{Sharma:2024,
	abstract = {As social media and web-based forums have grown in popularity, the fast-spreading trend of fake news has become a major threat to the government and other agencies. With the rise of social media and internet platforms, misinformation may quickly spread over borders and language boundaries. Detecting and neutralizing fake news in several languages can help to protect the integrity of global elections, political discourse, and public opinion. The lack of a robust multilingual database for training the classification models makes detecting fake news a difficult task. This paper looks at it by describing several forms of fake news (like serious fabrications, large-scale hoaxes, stance news, deceptive news, satire news, clickbait, misinformation, rumour). This review paper includes different steps, features, tools for mitigating the scourge of information pollution, and different available datasets. This study presented a taxonomy for detecting fake news, which gives a comprehensive overview and analysis of existing DL-based algorithms focusing on diverse techniques. This paper also includes the monolingual and multilingual fake news detection models. Finally, this paper ends with the technical challenges.},

@article{socsci9100185,
	abstract = {Combating the spread of fake news remains a difficult problem. For this reason, it is increasingly urgent to understand the phenomenon of fake news. This review aims to see why fake news is widely shared on social media and why some people believe it. The presentation of its structure (from the images chosen, the format of the titles and the language used in the text) can explain the reasons for going viral and what factors are associated with the belief in fake news. We show that fake news explores all possible aspects to attract the reader's attention, from the formation of the title to the language used throughout the body of the text. The proliferation and success of fake news are associated with its characteristics (more surreal, exaggerated, impressive, emotional, persuasive, clickbait, shocking images), which seem to be strategically thought out and exploited by the creators of fake news. This review shows that fake news continues to be widely shared and consumed because that is the main objective of its creators. Although some studies do not support these correlations, it appears that conservatives, right-wing people, the elderly and less educated people are more likely to believe and spread fake news.},
