            "Vergleichszahlen sprechen deutliche Sprache Studie: Schulschließung ohne Einfluss auf Corona-Pandemie Das Weiße Haus in Washington gab am Mittwoch bekannt, dass der polnische Präsident Andrzej Duda nächste Woche zu einem Treffen mit Donald Trump erwartet wird. Themen wurde keine bekannt, aber es gibt Hinweise darauf, dass eine Stationierung von US-Truppen in Polen auf der Agenda stehen könnte. Duda wird der erste Staatschef sein, der nach Ausbruch der Corona-Pandemie in den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika im Weißen Haus empfangen wird. Da die Ankündigung aus Washington und nicht aus Warschau kam, wird angenommen, dass es sich um eine Einladung des US-Präsidenten handelt. Zuvor hatten Dudas Berater erklärt, dass er erst wieder in die USA reisen werde, wenn es eine offizielle Einladung gebe. Das letzte Mal war der polnische Präsident im Juni vergangenen Jahres in Washington und warb damals um eine Aufstockung der US-Truppen in seinem Land. Ob es auch bei dem Besuch nächste Woche darum gehen wird, ist nicht bekannt. Allerdings findet das Treffen zwischen Trump und Duda zu einem Zeitpunkt statt, wo der angekündigte Teilabzug von mindestens 9.500 US-Soldaten aus Deutschland für jede Menge Wirbel nicht nur in der Bundesrepublik, sondern auch bei der NATO sorgt. In den USA stößt dieser Plan ebenfalls auf viel Kritik und Widerstand, auch in der eigenen Partei. In Polen hingegen ist es eher ein Mix aus Sorge und Vorfreude. Sorge davor, dass Europa auf der Washingtoner Prioritätenskala nach unten gerutscht ist. Und Vorfreude darauf, dass ein Teil dieser aus Deutschland abgezogenen Soldaten nach Polen kommen könnten. Ministerpräsident Mateusz Morawiecki sagte kurz nach den ersten Medienberichten über die Pläne des US-Präsidenten, dass er \"zutiefst hoffe\", dass \"einige\" der US-Soldaten in sein Land verlegt werden. Es würde die \"Ostflanke der NATO\" stärken, meinte er, da \"die wirkliche Gefahr hinter der Ostgrenze liegt\". Gemeint ist damit Russland. Konkrete Gespräche und Verhandlungen über eine Aufstockung der US-Präsenz in Polen laufen bereits seit mehr als einem Jahr. Andrzej Duda hatte bei seinem letzten Besuch in Washington sogar ein \"Fort Trump\" ins Spiel gebracht, um dem Präsidenten zu schmeicheln. Nur wenige Tage später zog der israelische Ministerpräsident\n"
