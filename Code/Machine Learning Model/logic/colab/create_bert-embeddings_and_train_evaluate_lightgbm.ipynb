Laut Experten wird die Pandemie das Problem weiter verschärfen.\\nDie Armut in Deutschland befindet sich derzeit auf einem Rekordhoch. Wie aus dem Armutsbericht des Paritätischen Wohlfahrtsverbandes hervorgeht, lebten im vergangenen Jahr 13,2 Millionen Menschen in Armut. Damit habe die Quote mit 15,9 Prozent den höchsten Wert seit der Wiedervereinigung erreicht. \\nBei den besonders betroffenen Gruppen, wie Alleinerziehenden, Arbeitslosen und kinderreichen Familien, habe die Armut von 2018 auf 2019 noch einmal zugenommen. Jeder dritte erwachsene Arme ist dem Bericht zufolge erwerbstätig (33 Prozent) oder in Rente (knapp 30 Prozent). \\n\\u2028\\u2028Im Süden des Landes haben Bayern und Baden-Württemberg eine gemeinsame Armutsquote von 12,1 Prozent. Der Rest Deutschlands, vom Osten über den Norden bis in den Westen, kommt zusammen auf eine Quote von 17,4 Prozent. Außerhalb Bayerns und Baden-Württembergs lebt durchschnittlich mehr als jeder Sechste unterhalb der Armutsgrenze.\\nAm stärksten von Armut betroffen bleibt das bevölkerungsreichste Bundesland Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW), mit einer Armutsquote von 21,4 Prozent. Hier wuchs die Quote seit 2006 zweieinhalbmal so schnell wie im Rest Deutschlands. \\nLaut Angaben des Paritätischen Wohlfahrtsverbandes wird die Corona-Pandemie Armut und soziale Ungleichheit außerdem weiter verschärfen. Davon seien vor allem geringfügig Beschäftigte sowie junge Menschen betroffen. \"Corona hat jahrelang verharmloste und verdrängte Probleme, von der Wohnraumversorgung einkommensschwacher Haushalte bis hin zur Bildungssegregation armer Kinder, ans Licht gezerrt\", sagte Hauptgeschäftsführer Ulrich Schneider. \\nDer Verband forderte deshalb die sofortige Anhebung der finanziellen Unterstützungsleistungen für arme Menschen sowie armutsfeste Reformen der Sozialversicherungen. Der Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund bekräftigte angesichts der Zahlen seine Forderung nach einem Mindestlohn von zwölf Euro und eine Kindergrundsicherung. \\nDie Zahl der von Armut bedrohten Kindern und Jugendlichen ist laut Angaben des Statistischen Bundesamtes im Vergleich zum vergangenen Jahr hingegen gesunken. Derzeit seien 15 Prozent von Armut bedroht, 2018 waren es noch 17,3 Prozent.\\nDer relative Armutsbegriff des Verbandes orientiert sich am Nettoeinkommen.

            "{'text': 'Bundesfinanzminister Olaf Scholz erwägt erneute Aussetzung der Schuldenbremse Der Mietendeckel verfehlt seine Wirkung nicht, die Mieten sinken. Der größte Wohnungsverband jedoch warnt vor weniger Neubau und mehr unsanierten Häusern.\\xa0 Seit etwas mehr als einem Jahr gilt in Berlin das Mietendeckel-Gesetz. Die Folgen sind für die Wohnungsunternehmen in der Hauptstadt deutlich zu spüren – und werden aus Sicht des Verbandes Berlin-Brandenburgischer Wohnungsunternehmen (BBU) noch zunehmen.\\nDas geht aus mehreren in der ersten Jahreshälfte durchgeführten Umfragen des BBU unter seinen mehr als 300 Mitgliedsunternehmen hervor. Die Ergebnisse stellte die BBU-Vorsitzende Maren Kern am Donnerstagvormittag in Berlin vor.\\nDemnach stieg das Investitionsvolumen der BBU-Mitgliedsunternehmen 2019 zwar auf einen neuen Rekordwert von 2,7 Milliarden Euro, der Zuwachs der Investitionen verlangsamte sich aber deutlich.\\nZwischen 2018 und 2019 lag das Plus bei sechs Prozent, dem niedrigsten Wert seit sieben Jahren. Zum Vergleich: Zwischen 2017 und 2018 waren die Investitionen um 25 Prozent gestiegen.\\nEine Entwicklung, die BBU-Chefin Kern klar als Folge des Mietendeckels wertet. „Der Mietendeckel verhindert, dass Modernisierungen und Investitionen ausreichend finanziert werden können“, erklärte sie und warnte davor, dass die Planbarkeit von Investitionen wegen der Unsicherheit des Mietendeckels nicht gegeben sei. Dieser wird aktuell vom Bundesverfassungsgericht überprüft.\\nFür das laufende Jahr 2020 wiederum planen die BBU-Mitglieder Investitionen in Höhe von 3,8 Milliarden Euro – ebenfalls ein neuer Rekordwert. Allerdings stammen diese Pläne aus der Zeit vor Corona und teilweise sogar vor dem Mietendeckel, dessen Eckpunkte und Auswirkungen zum Zeitpunkt der Planungen teilweise noch unbekannt waren.\\nEbenfalls offensichtlich: Die hemmende Wirkung des Mietendeckels auf geplante Neubauprojekte der Mitgliedsunternehmen, von denen die deutliche Mehrheit im kommunalen Besitz liegen oder Genossenschaften sind. Etwas mehr als 50 Prozent von ihnen rechnen damit, dass der Mietendeckel Neubauinvestitionen komplett, deutlich oder leicht verhindert.\\nMinus 43 Prozent bei neugebauten Genossenschaftswohnungen\\nAllein 25 Prozent davon rechnen mit einer Reduktion der Neubauzahlen auf Null. Schon 2019 ist die Zahl der von Genossenschaften gebauten Wohnungen um fast 43 Prozent zum Vorjahr eingebrochen. Im selben Jahr sank die Quote gelegter Grundsteine aller BBU-Mitgliedsunternehmen um 32 Prozent.\\nZwar stieg die Zahl der Baufertigstellungen im Vergleich zu den Vorjahren erneut, die Differenz zwischen Ist und Soll erhöhte sich jedoch weiter. Sie lag 2019 bei 27 Prozent. Will sagen: Jede dritte von den BBU-Mitgliedsunternehmen geplante Wohnung wurde nicht gebaut. Als Ursache gelten neben den unsicheren Zukunftsperspektiven unter anderem steigende Baupreise. Diese stiegen allein zwischen 2018 und 2019 um sieben Prozent, die Wohnkosten und damit Einnahmen der BBU-Unternehmen erhöhten sich im selben Zeitraum um 1,6 Prozent.\\nDie Neubauzahlen dürften also weiter sinken – und sich damit von den Zielmarken der Stadtentwicklungssenatorin Katrin Lompscher (Linke) entfernen. Die Entwicklung der Baugenehmigungen ging zwischen 2016 und 2019 laut BBU um 10,1 Prozent zurück. Der coronabedingte Lockdown tat sein Übriges, zahlreiche Verwaltungen waren aus dem Homeoffice heraus so gut wie nicht arbeitsfähig. Vorsichtige Hochrechnungen auf Basis des ersten Quartals 2020 zeigten, dass sich die Entwicklung fortsetzen und möglicherweise sogar verschärfen wird, erklärte Kern.\\nFast die Hälfte der Unternehmen rechnet mit weniger Sanierungen\\nEbenfalls eindeutig ist der Befund mit Blick auf geplante Investitionen in Modernisierungen. Nur 15 Prozent der Unternehmen gaben an, dass der Mietendeckel keinerlei Reduktion der Modernisierungsausgaben zur Folge haben wird. 46 Prozent rechnen damit, dass deutlich weniger Geld in Modernisierungsmaßnahmen investiert wird. Im Bereich der Instandhaltung sehen mehr als 60 Prozent der Unternehmen deutliche und leichte Investitionsrückgänge auf sich zukommen.\\nWährend Christian Gräff, wohnungspolitischer Sprecher der CDU-Fraktion im Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus, von einem \"wohnungspolitischen Scherbenhaufen\" sprach und erklärte, die Mieter müssten nun \"die Negativ-Folgen des sogenannten Mietendeckels ertragen\", kritisierte FDP-Fraktionschef Sebastian Czaja: \"Das größte Problem für den Wohnungsmarkt in Berlin ist eine ideologische Politik, die Realitäten einfach ignoriert. Die nicht realisierten Neubauvorhaben von BBU-Unternehmen sei \"logische Folge der linken Chaos-Koalition\" und \"eine Katastrophe für Berlins Mieterinnen und Mieter\".\\nKatrin Schmidberger wiederum, Wohnungsmarktexpertin der Grünen-Fraktion und Verteidigerin des Mietendeckels, erklärte: \"Der Neubau bricht wegen den steigenden Bau- und Grundstückspreisen ein, nicht wegen dem Mietendeckel.\" Sie plädierte für \"Kompensationen zugunsten von gemeinwohlorientierten Bauträgern\" wie Genossenschaften und mahnte unter anderem eine \"bessere Neubauförderung\" an. Tatsächlich stürzten dessen Zahlen im laufenden Jahr regelrecht ab. Einer dem Tagesspiegel vorliegenden Auflistung der Finanzverwaltung zufolge wurden 2020 bislang drei Anträge auf Wohnungsneubauförderung bewilligt. Im vergangenen Jahr waren es 1778 bewilligte Wohnungen - bereits damals blieb die Zahl deutlich unter dem Soll von 4000 geförderten Wohnungen.\\nDie Werte des BBU wiederum, die Mitglieder des Verbands besitzen mehr als 700.000 Wohnungen in Berlin und stellen damit etwa 43 Prozent des Mietwohnungsbestandes, passen zur jüngsten Kritik der sechs landeseigenen Wohnungsbaugesellschaften an der Politik des Senats. Sie warfen Lompscher mit Blick auf Verhandlungen über eine neue Kooperationsvereinbarung unter anderem vor, den Unternehmen den wirtschaftlichen Spielraum für Investitionen zu nehmen.\\nIm Fokus stehen geplante Vorgaben, denen zufolge drei von vier Neubauwohnungen an Bezieher eines Wohnberechtigungsscheines vergeben werden sollen. Außerdem soll der Höchstpreis je Quadratmeter im Neubau bei zwölf Euro gedeckelt werden, der Durchschnitt dürfe zehn Euro nicht überschreiten.\\nVier von fünf Neubauprojekten könnten gestrichen werden\\nDarüber hinaus sollen die Regelungen des Mietendeckels für die landeseigenen Unternehmen auch dann gelten, wenn dieser vor dem Bundesverfassungsgericht scheitert. „Interessant“ nannte Kern diesen Vorschlag und warnte davor, die Unternehmen nicht zu überfordern. Sie schlug ihrerseits eine Schärfung des sozialen Mietrechts vor und nannte als Beispiel die Verschärfung der Mietpreisbremse.\\nStatt wie bislang maximal 15 Prozent Mieterhöhung in drei Jahren könne sie sich eine Deckelung von Mieterhöhungen bei zehn Prozent auf vier Jahre vorstellen, erklärte Kern. Sie betonte jedoch, diesen Vorschlag nicht als Reaktion auf den Mietendeckel zu machen. „Wir wollen konstruktive Vorschläge machen und haben das auch schon vor dem Mietendeckel getan“, erklärte Kern.\\nZuletzt war mit Blick auf die laufenden Verhandlungen zwischen der Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung sowie den landeseigenen Gesellschaften über eine neue Kooperationsvereinbarung von einer frostigen Stimmung die Rede. Einzelne Gesellschaften gehen davon aus, dass im Fall des Inkrafttretens der Vereinbarung in der Entwurfsfassung vier von fünf Neubauprojekten gestrichen werden müssen.\\nHinzu kommen Modernisierungen und Instandhaltungen, die dann nicht wie geplant und stattdessen erst in weiter Ferner durchgeführt werden können.', 'label': 0}\n"
